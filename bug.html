  <div id="myDiv">
    This text should be visible.
  </div>
  <script>
    // This script attempts to modify the content of the div element,
    // but it uses a non-standard way to access the content which could fail
    // in certain browsers or situations.
    document.getElementById("myDiv").textContent = "This text should replace the previous one.";
    //The bug is that the textContent property of the div element might not be always properly updated, and the text may not always be replaced
    document.getElementById("myDiv").innerText = "This text should replace the previous one.";
    //Another way to write the same thing, but it might produce unexpected results in the same way as the previous one.
